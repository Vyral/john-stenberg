        "content": "Here’s what’s been happening in the first six months of the 2021 market.In today’s market update, I’m going to compare the numbers in six ZIP codes from May 2021 to the same month last year. Let’s start with median home prices:  Area code 91910 (Chula Vista): $735,000—up 27.2% over last year  Area code 91911 (Chula Vista): $635,000—up 20% over last year  Area code 91913 (Otay Ranch, Eastlake): $765,000—up 23% over last year  Area code 91902 (Bonita): $908,000—up 17% over last year  Area code 91914 (Rolling Hills Ranch): $935,000—up 16% over last year  South San Diego: $630,000—up 14% over last yearOf all those ZIP codes, the area with the highest rate of appreciation is Bonita with over 43%. If you own an attached property in Bonita, now is a good time to sell, cash out, or do a 1031 exchange.“These trends will likely continue for at least the next six months as home prices continue upward.”In the next six months, prices are expected to inch upward as inventory remains low. Interest rates are likely going to stay the same, which is currently about 3.25%. In our current market, we’re also seeing more and more buyers backing out of transactions. Here are the four things they’re worried about most:1. Buyer’s remorse. In the heat of the moment, buyers are getting worried about overpaying for properties, so they go home to sleep on it and ultimately end up backing out of the deal.2. Buyers don’t like a lot of repairs. Many don’t mind paying top dollar for a great property, but they don’t like to have to deal with a lot of repairs. If you have a property as a seller, make sure it’s in good condition; if it isn’t, you can expect buyers to hit you up for repairs.3. Appraisal issues. If you don’t have an appraisal gap clause in your contract, the buyer can easily back out of the transaction if the property doesn’t appraise correctly.4. Poor decisions on the sellers’ part. Many sellers aren’t vetting their buyers; they’re focused on getting the highest possible price, not on getting the best offer altogether.These trends will likely continue for at least the next six months as home prices continue upward.If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in today’s market, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to sit down with you for a consultation.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here’s why I don’t believe we’re in a housing bubble right now.The most common question I’ve been hearing lately is, “Are we in a housing bubble?” Today I’m going over a few reasons why we’re not.Although there are some similarities between this market and the one we saw before the previous market crash, right now we simply have an issue with inventory that has been coming for many years. This is a completely different market from the last bubble and subsequent crash. That was caused by bad loans, which aren’t around these days.Home inventory is so low that we have a 50-year low on building new construction homes. We are 3.8 million new homes behind schedule.“Those bad loans from 2008 aren’t around today.”If you’re here in San Diego, we have a surplus of people moving here that’s further compounding our inventory issues. We have 24,000 people moving here each year, but we’re only building 12,000 new units.Another factor is that homeowners are staying in their properties longer and building up more equity. We aren’t seeing many defaults anymore, and homeowners have more equity than they ever have. 56% of homeowners have over 50% equity. All of these reasons point to a much different market than a bubble. This is still a great market to be a home seller in, and low interest rates have made homes very affordable for buyers.If you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "How to Get an Offer Accepted in Today’s Market",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are three tips for strengthening your offer in this competitive market.Here are three things that you must do when making an offer in today’s real estate market to increase your chances of getting that offer accepted:1. Be educated. Listen to your agent. Do extra research on home values in the neighborhood you’re choosing to buy into. Don’t look at the past 60 or 90 days. Look at the leading indicators (i.e., pending and closed sales).2. Offer an appraisal gap clause. If you make an offer of $525,000 on a home that’s listed at $500,000, you need to let the seller know that you’re willing to go up to that price even if the home’s appraisal comes in lower.“Educate yourself on the market and pay close attention to leading indicators.”3. Offer a seller rent-back. With our low inventory of homes, sellers are worried about finding their next home. Offering a rent-back upfront gives sellers peace of mind that they will have time to find a new home in this competitive home-buying market.Bonus tip: Don’t give up! We’re expecting home appreciation to hit 9% this year in San Diego. It’s really tough out there right now, but if you work with an experienced agent who knows the neighborhood you want to buy in, you’re in a much better position to win. And you will win if you stay patient.If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are my top tips for selling a San Diego rental property in 2021.Here are three things you must do if you’re selling a rental property in 2021:1. Start early. If you’re thinking about selling in the summer, start preparing now. You need 60 to 90 days to get your home ready. Start working on your curb appeal, exterior photos, and notify the tenants of the situation (and have them sign the necessary paperwork).2. Focus on pricing. Right now, home prices are at an all-time high and they might go up another 9% this year. Even so, homes need to be priced properly based on their condition.3. Prepare the tenants and owner to sell in one day. If you do the right marketing in advance, you’re going to be able to sell that rental property in just one weekend.Bonus tip: Give some type of incentive to a tenant for being cooperative. In today’s rent-control and COVID market, you want to assure your success by giving some type of cash incentive to the tenant.If you have any questions for me about selling a rental property or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "content": "Here’s how our market is doing and where we believe it’s headed this year.What’s happening in the real estate market? I get asked this question almost daily, so today I’m sharing how our market’s doing and what we expect it to do throughout the year. With low interest rates, low inventory, and the pandemic, 2020 created the perfect seller’s market, but those rates also made a great buyer’s market. The 10-Year Treasury is pushing up interest rates, and we’ll likely see 3.25% to 3.5% be the norm; we believe the 2% range is over.“We have an inventory issue, and that’s why we’re seeing a frenzy of 20 to 40 offers on one property.”In 2010, we had over 20,000 homes on the market, right after the foreclosure housing crisis. We currently have 2,200 houses on the market; we have an inventory issue, and that’s why we’re seeing a frenzy of 20 to 40 offers on one property. In the U.S., we’re short approximately 360,000 units each year in building for our growing population.The median home price in South County is $635,000 and appreciated 24% year over year; in the metro area, it’s $666,000 and appreciated 9.6%; East County is $575,000 with 13% appreciation, and North County is at $800,000 with 12.7% appreciation. According to CoreLogic, a data provider for the real estate and mortgage industries, San Diego has seen 11% appreciation across the board from last year, and they predict up to 9.6% more appreciation in 2021. We think we’ll see a roller coaster between March and May.Rates will increase a bit, causing buyers to feel the pressure to go out and buy a home. We also predict buyers will have a little more inventory to choose from because more homeowners are getting vaccinated, and they’ll feel more comfortable putting their houses up for sale.If you’d like more information, you can view Mortgage News Daily’s article Home Price Appreciation Broke an 8-Year Record in January.If you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, call or email us.

        "content": "When you buy a home, there is a 17-day default clause in the contract that all of your inspections and investigations will be performed during. You’re also obligated to deal with requests for repairs if there are any discrepancies that you’re not satisfied with. I would recommend that you get your inspection ordered right away after your offer is accepted. Then, make sure you get all of the seller’s reports and disclosures before you start doing your inspections. Finally, you may want to go straight to a specialist if a home is older. They will give you estimates of what the repairs would cost so that you have the information to give to the seller. “I recommend ordering an inspection right away.”Talk to your agent and determine whether a general or a specialty inspection is the right decision for the property you’re interested in.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are four common mistakes buyers make during the home buying process that you need to avoid: 1. Not talking to a lender. It’s one thing to get pre-qualified over the phone, but it’s another thing to actually sit down with a lender, go over the loan process, provide them with all the necessary financial documents, and have an underwriter grant you a pre-approval. When in doubt, always shoot for a pre-approval instead of a pre-qualification, because that will make you a more attractive buyer in today’s market. 2. Not discussing your wants and needs with your agent. Communication is key when working with your agent, so make sure you sit down and have a conversation with them about what kinds of neighborhoods you’re looking to live in. They’ll do a much better job if you’re clear with them about what a perfect home means to you. “Communication is key when working with your agent.”3. Not discussing the maximum price you’ll pay with your agent. This will help them during the negotiation process, and it will increase the odds you won’t have to actually pay that price. If you don’t trust your agent with this type of information, you should probably find yourself another agent. 4. Not connecting with the seller. A home sale is an emotional transaction for both parties, so writing a letter to the seller or making a video for them about why you want to buy their home and how you’ll take care of it can go a long way in gaining their favor. Case in point: I recently represented a buyer who won out in a multiple-offer situation despite not having the highest bid because they took the time to make a video and send it to the seller. If you have any other questions about buying a home or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "title": "Maximize Your Home’s Sale Price With These 5 Tips",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are the top five ways to maximize your home’s sale price when preparing it for the market:1. After you sign the listing agreement, start filling out your disclosures to give to the buyer. Sometimes, people are so wrapped up in getting their property ready for the market that they forget about the disclosures. Doing this could potentially delay the escrow process and cause problems after the close of escrow. 2. Get your pre-inspections taken care of. If you order your home’s inspections before talking to a serious buyer and then let them know about the home’s condition up front, you can negotiate over which repairs to make before coming to terms on a price. This will save you a lot of money. 3. Stage the home. I’ve found that you can increase your sale price by 5% to 25% if you walk through your home with a real estate agent and do whatever needs to be done (decluttering, recarpeting, repainting, etc.) to stage it before putting it on the market. “When pricing your home, focus on the leading indicators instead of the lagging indicators.”4. Start the pre-marketing process early on. In the old days, sellers would list their property on a Tuesday, take photos of it on Wednesday, get it ready for the market on Friday, and have an open house on Saturday or Sunday. Good agents know that the new way of doing things involves pre-marketing your property weeks in advance of listing it in order to expose it to the most buyers possible. 5. Make sure you’re still the clear choice in price. When pricing your home, focus on the leading indicators instead of the lagging indicators. The market has shifted, and we previously relied on lagging indicators like sold comps and the list-to-sale price ratio to price a property. Now, leading indicators like the supply of inventory, the average days on market, and the number of pending properties will tell you what’s happening now and in the next 30 to 60 days. Right now, more properties are extending their average days on market than ever before.If you’re thinking of making a move in 2019, give me a call so I can help you get started and position your home to sell for top dollar.

Buyers want to be able to visualize themselves living in the property, not the family that already lives there, so remove any personal pictures or mementos.Second, change the layout of the furniture. Make sure the furniture in each room has a nice flow to it. If you need to remove some furniture to make that happen, go ahead and do it. In fact, make sure you evaluate each room with your real estate agent and focus on what furniture you can remove.“Buyers want to be able to visualize themselves living in the property, not the family that already lives there.”Third, declutter the property.

        "title": "5 Tips for Getting the Most Money Possible From Your Next Home Sale",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "With my 32 years of experience in real estate, I’ve found that there are five simple things that need to be aligned in order to sell your property for the maximum amount possible:1. Condition. When I say condition, I mean both the interior and exterior of the home. To make your home look, smell, and feel its best, make sure that it’s well staged. Boost the appeal of your bathroom, kitchen, and living room with some nice decor and furniture, and also be sure to declutter. Fix the little repairs that have been bugging you for a while. Repaint the exterior to give it a fresh look, repaint the interior to capitalize on the hottest color trends in the market, and be sure to spruce up your landscaping to enhance your curb appeal. For every $1 you put into staging your home, you could get $7 back.2. Price. We’re still in a seller’s market right now, which means that you shouldn’t ask too much for your property. Instead, price your home to make your listing a clear choice in terms of value to buyers looking in your area. I go over three pricing strategies with my clients, and I’ll be happy to sit down with you to discuss each one to figure out which is right for your situation.3. Motivation. In terms of motivation on a scale of one to 10, you have to be a 10. That means that you shouldn’t throw out the sale altogether if you don’t get the exact price you want—the market dictates the price. Don’t be a spec seller; buyers will respond to the story that you give them about why you’re selling your home, and if you’re selling because you need to upsize or if you’re relocating for work, they’ll respond accordingly.“In terms of motivation on a scale of one to 10, you have to be a 10.”4. Commission. Commission is a powerful marketing tool; if you’re offering commission to a selling broker, agents are going to be attracted to that property to help you sell it because they’ll know that they’ll be paid for their services. Agents do not make salaries in this business. If a buyer’s agent is showing your property and you’re only offering a 1% commission as opposed to 2.5% or 3%, they’re probably not going to be too excited, even if their client wants to see the property. However, if they’re getting paid for their time, they’ll be very motivated to go the extra mile to make the deal work, and you as the seller will benefit.5. Access. When you list a property and place restrictions on the times that showings can occur (e.g., only in the evenings, on weekends, or only during open houses), you’re actually restricting the exposure of your listing. Highly motivated buyers might want to see your home the same day they see your listing, but if they have to wait several days to see it, they could find another property they like in the meantime. Had they seen your property when they wanted to, they might have made an offer that same day. My advice? Make it easy for a buyer’s agent to access and show your house so that you can attract highly motivated buyers.If you have these five things all in order when you list your property with the Stenberg Group, I can guarantee you that we’re going to get the most money possible for your home sale—and fast.So, if you’re thinking about selling your home in today’s market, I would love to sit down with you and give you a marketing consultation, during which we’ll cover exactly what’s going on in your neighborhood.

        "content": "What’s going on in our market? Is it a buyer’s market or a seller’s market?Now that 2019 is right around the corner, the market is starting to balance out and shift toward more of a buyer’s market. There’s more inventory available, the number of sales is dropping, and buyers are doing more negotiating in their offers. Specifically, the North County luxury market is definitely slowing down, and I’m seeing a lot of price reductions in that area. As far as interest rates are concerned, experts predict that they’ll keep rising in 2019. Although they might go as high as 5.25% (or, as a worst-case scenario, 5.5%), the good news is I don’t think they’ll get close to the 6% mark. If you’re a buyer, this means you’ll have a higher mortgage payment. If you’re a seller, this means you’ll have a smaller buyer pool to work with. A lot of sellers hear this and are tempted to wait six months or a year to list, but if you’re thinking about doing that, I’d first advise that you sit down with your agent and strategize over the best time to put your home on the market. “As we enter 2019, we should see a more normal market emerge.”How does inventory look moving forward? As with interest rates, inventory will keep increasing in 2019. Right now, we’re seeing a lot of potential sellers get off the fence and list their homes specifically because of rising interest rates. If you’re a seller, this means you have to be more competitive when pricing your home and preparing it for the market. Obviously, this is good news if you’re a buyer because it means you’ll have more homes to choose from. In the past, you didn’t have the chance to be this picky—if you saw a home you liked, you had to hurry up and bid on it. Sometimes, you’d also find yourself in a multiple-offer situation and have to pay over list price. Those days are mostly a thing of the past, though, and as we enter 2019, we should see a more normal market emerge. Whether you’re buying or selling a home right now, it’s crucial that you sit down and talk with someone who has their finger on the pulse of the market so that you get the best deal possible. If you have any other questions about our current market or you have any other real estate needs I can take care of, feel free to call or email me anytime.
