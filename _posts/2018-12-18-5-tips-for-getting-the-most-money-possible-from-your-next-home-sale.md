With my 32 years of experience in real estate, I’ve found that there are five simple things that need to be aligned in order to sell your property for the maximum amount possible:

**1. Condition.** When I say condition, I mean both the interior and exterior of the home. To make your home look, smell, and feel its best, make sure that it’s well staged. Boost the appeal of your bathroom, kitchen, and living room with some nice decor and furniture, and also be sure to declutter. Fix the little repairs that have been bugging you for a while. Repaint the exterior to give it a fresh look, repaint the interior to capitalize on the hottest color trends in the market, and be sure to spruce up your landscaping to enhance your curb appeal. For every $1 you put into staging your home, you could get $7 back.

<br>**2. Price.** We’re still in a seller’s market right now, which means that you shouldn’t ask too much for your property. Instead, price your home to make your listing a clear choice in terms of value to buyers looking in your area. I go over three pricing strategies with my clients, and I’ll be happy to sit down with you to discuss each one to figure out which is right for your situation.

<br>**3. Motivation.** In terms of motivation on a scale of one to 10, you have to be a 10. That means that you shouldn’t throw out the sale altogether if you don’t get the exact price you want—the market dictates the price. Don’t be a spec seller; buyers will respond to the story that you give them about why you’re selling your home, and if you’re selling because you need to upsize or if you’re relocating for work, they’ll respond accordingly.

<br>**4. Commission.** Commission is a powerful marketing tool; if you’re offering commission to a selling broker, agents are going to be attracted to that property to help you sell it because they'll know that they’ll be paid for their services. Agents do not make salaries in this business. If a buyer’s agent is showing your property and you’re only offering a 1% commission as opposed to 2.5% or 3%, they’re probably not going to be too excited, even if their client wants to see the property. However, if they’re getting paid for their time, they’ll be very motivated to go the extra mile to make the deal work, and you as the seller will benefit.

<br>**5. Access.** When you list a property and place restrictions on the times that showings can occur (e.g., only in the evenings, on weekends, or only during open houses), you’re actually restricting the exposure of your listing. Highly motivated buyers might want to see your home the same day they see your listing, but if they have to wait several days to see it, they could find another property they like in the meantime. Had they seen your property when they wanted to, they might have made an offer that same day. My advice? Make it easy for a buyer’s agent to access and show your house so that you can attract highly motivated buyers.

If you have these five things all in order when you list your property with the Stenberg Group, I can guarantee you that we’re going to get the most money possible for your home sale—and fast.
