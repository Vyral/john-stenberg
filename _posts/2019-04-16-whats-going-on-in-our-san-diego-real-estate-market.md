A lot of people come up to me on a daily basis, asking, “What’s going on with the market?”&nbsp;

Well, it all depends on what you’re looking to buy, sell, rent, or invest in a home. **Each one is different, and there are certain strategies that work best for each option.**

Right now, the median price of a San Diego home is $570,000. Interest rates are as low as 4%, which means it’s an incredible time to buy. In addition, homes are on the market for a mere 28 days before they’re sold. We still have a low level of inventory, meaning we’re in a seller’s market.

If you want to buy now, it’s a good idea to work with an agent who knows the market inside and out. If you want to sell, use a proven strategy in order to net top dollar on your sale. **I’d be more than happy to help you with your real estate needs and answer any questions you may have.** In the meantime, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
