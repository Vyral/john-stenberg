If you live in San Diego, the median price for a home is $850,000. If your eyebrows raised at that number, then you may be one of the many people considering buying a condo right now. Today, I’ll go over the pros and cons of buying a condo in our crazy housing market.&nbsp;

**The biggest and most obvious pro to buying a condo is that it is an affordable way to get into home ownership.** In today’s market, there are a lot of reasonably well-off people who can’t spring for an $850,000 price tag. Buying a condo could be an affordable way to invest in a housing market you would otherwise miss out on.&nbsp;

**On the other hand, a big con of condos is their restrictions.** Low storage space, lack of parking, and homeowner’s associations are all restrictions you might have to deal with if you buy a condo. These can be a dealbreaker to some, but for others, they are hardly noticeable. If you are downsizing, for example, lack of storage space is probably not an issue.&nbsp;

**If you plan on buying a condo, I highly recommend getting on the phone with your agent or HOA representative to ask them some questions.** The biggest questions you should ask are what is the HOA fee, what does the HOA entail, and what is the HOA policy on pets? Pets can actually be a big one. Every HOA is different, so finding out their exact policy on your furry friends is a big deal.&nbsp;

The last question you should ask is, “What are the HOA reserves?” If they don’t have a lot of reserves, you may be subject to an assessment in the future. **No one wants to have this sprung on them out of nowhere, so asking ahead of time is crucial.**&nbsp;
