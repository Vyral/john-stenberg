As you probably already know, along with Compass, I’m a proud sponsor of the San Diego Padres at Petco Park this year. 

With this in mind, I’m excited to bring something else to your attention: We’ll be hosting more than 40 theme nights at the ballpark this year, and you’re invited to attend any and all of them\! I’ve written down my personal favorites, so feel free to contact me or visit our website for further information. Some of my favorites include: 

* Autism Awareness Night 
* Nurse’s Appreciation Weekend
* Winefest 
* Party in the Park 
* 80s Night—Party in the Park 
* Margaritaville Night, for the Parrotheads who love margaritas and Jimmy Buffet   
* Beerfest 
* Bruce Lee Tribute Night, with a Bruce Lee t-shirt giveaway
* Star Wars Night, for all you Star Wars fanatics out there
* Filipino Night—my entire family will be attending this one
