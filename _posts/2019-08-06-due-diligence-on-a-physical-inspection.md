When you buy a home, there is a 17-day default clause in the contract that all of your inspections and investigations will be performed during. You’re also obligated to deal with requests for repairs if there are any discrepancies that you’re not satisfied with.&nbsp;

**I would recommend that you get your inspection ordered right away after your offer is accepted.** Then, make sure you get all of the seller’s reports and disclosures before you start doing your inspections. Finally, you may want to go straight to a specialist if a home is older. They will give you estimates of what the repairs would cost so that you have the information to give to the seller.&nbsp;

**Talk to your agent and determine whether a general or a specialty inspection is the right decision for the property you're interested in.** If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
