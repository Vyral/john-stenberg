Here are three things you must do if you’re selling a rental property in 2021:

**1\. Start early.** If you're thinking about selling in the summer, start preparing now. You need 60 to 90 days to get your home ready. Start working on your curb appeal, exterior photos, and notify the tenants of the situation (and have them sign the necessary paperwork).

**2\. Focus on pricing.** Right now, home prices are at an all-time high and they might go up another 9% this year. Even so, homes need to be priced properly based on their condition.

**3\. Prepare the tenants and owner to sell in one day.** If you do the right marketing in advance, you're going to be able to sell that rental property in just one weekend.

**Bonus tip:** Give some type of incentive to a tenant for being cooperative. In today’s rent-control and COVID market, you want to assure your success by giving some type of cash incentive to the tenant.

If you have any questions for me about selling a rental property or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
