Here are four common mistakes buyers make during the home buying process that you need to avoid:&nbsp;

**1. Not talking to a lender.** It’s one thing to get pre-qualified over the phone, but it’s another thing to actually sit down with a lender, go over the loan process, provide them with all the necessary financial documents, and have an underwriter grant you a pre-approval. When in doubt, always shoot for a pre-approval instead of a pre-qualification, because that will make you a more attractive buyer in today’s market.&nbsp;

**2. Not discussing your wants and needs with your agent.** Communication is key when working with your agent, so make sure you sit down and have a conversation with them about what kinds of neighborhoods you’re looking to live in. They’ll do a much better job if you’re clear with them about what a perfect home means to you.&nbsp;

**3. Not discussing the maximum price you’ll pay with your agent.** This will help them during the negotiation process, and it will increase the odds you won’t have to actually pay that price. If you don’t trust your agent with this type of information, you should probably find yourself another agent.&nbsp;

**4. Not connecting with the seller.** A home sale is an emotional transaction for both parties, so writing a letter to the seller or making a video for them about why you want to buy their home and how you’ll take care of it can go a long way in gaining their favor. Case in point: I recently represented a buyer who won out in a multiple-offer situation despite not having the highest bid because they took the time to make a video and send it to the seller.&nbsp;
