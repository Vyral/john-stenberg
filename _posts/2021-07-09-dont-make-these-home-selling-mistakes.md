In today’s seller’s market, I’m still seeing sellers make some critical mistakes that end up costing them tens of thousands of dollars. Here are the three most common mistakes that you should avoid at all costs:

**1\. Selling a home as-is.** This is just not good enough if you want top dollar. Cleaning up, decluttering, and sprucing up your curb appeal will go a long way to maximizing your sale price. I’ve been seeing too many sellers not doing anything to prepare their homes and they’re selling for thousands less than they should.

**2\. Overpricing the property.** Many sellers think, “Let’s just shoot for the moon and see who bites.” However, this strategy is causing their homes to sit stagnant on the market for long periods. Serious buyers are passing these homes by and it shows. If you price competitively from the start, you’ll get more buyers, more showings, more offers, and more control of the transaction.

**3\. Not giving adequate access to the property.** I’ve seen a lot of listings with very strict showing timelines. That just doesn’t work for every buyer. You want to give full access to buyers so that more of them see your home. Let your agent do the work for you by giving them full access to the property for showings.

If you’re thinking about making a move in this hot market, don’t make these mistakes. If you have any questions about what your home could fetch in today’s market or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
