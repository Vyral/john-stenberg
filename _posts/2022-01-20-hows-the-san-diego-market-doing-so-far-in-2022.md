I receive questions every day like, “What’s going on with the market?” and “How can I win?” Today I have a brief update on the San Diego real estate market to share with all of you.

**We’re currently experiencing our hottest market ever.** I think it will stay this way for the next two years at least. What’s causing this? Lack of construction is a major factor. We’re four million units short of where we should be right now. Low inventory levels are causing home prices to continue to rise. There are fewer than 2,000 homes available for sale in San Diego County right now, which is incredible.

**Another factor driving our market is low interest rates.** Buyers can buy more of a home with lower rates, so they’re increasing their budgets.&nbsp;

San Diego is the best place to live in the country, and it’s not all just the climate. The lifestyle, the affordability, and the booming real estate market are just three of the reasons why people are coming to San Diego from all over the world.

If you’re a buyer in this market, you need a strategy and an experienced agent on your side. If you're a seller, you’re going to get multiple offers, so you can bet on getting the right price and the right terms with the help of your agent.

If you have any questions for me about buying, selling, or real estate in general, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
