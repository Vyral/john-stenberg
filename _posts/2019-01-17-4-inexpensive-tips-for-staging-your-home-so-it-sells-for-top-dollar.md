Here are four cost-friendly home staging tips that will help you sell quickly and for top dollar.

First, **depersonalize the property**. Buyers want to be able to visualize themselves living in the property, not the family that already lives there, so remove any personal pictures or mementos.

Second, **change the layout of the furniture.** Make sure the furniture in each room has a nice flow to it. If you need to remove some furniture to make that happen, go ahead and do it. In fact, make sure you evaluate each room with your real estate agent and focus on what furniture you can remove.

Third, **declutter the property**. For example, if you have any magazines or unused boxes laying around, place those items into storage somewhere.

Lastly, **deep clean the whole place**. Specifically, focus on the bathrooms, the kitchen, and the floors. The floors are especially important if you have pets.
