Have you ever been in a position to sell your home only to realize that you don’t have the money to make the upgrades and repairs you need to?&nbsp;

**Compass Concierge, our team’s newest marketing program, takes care of this problem for you.&nbsp;**

Statistics say that when you stage your home and make all the necessary cosmetic repairs, you tend to sell for 5% to 20% more. Also, 83% of all buyer’s agents say that their buyers can better visualize themselves living in a home during a showing if the home’s been upgraded.&nbsp;

These are numbers you can’t ignore, and Compass Concierge helps you sell your home faster and for more money by covering the cost of services to prepare your home for the market. Whether you need a new roof, carpet, A/C unit, etc., nothing is off the list.&nbsp;

The best part about this program is that there are no hidden costs or upfront charges. You get billed at the close of escrow, and the vendors get paid before that. It’s a win-win situation for everyone involved.&nbsp;
